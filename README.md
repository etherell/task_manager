# Task manager for RubyGarage

To achieve all requirements I used next libraries and technologies:

- Bootstrap for styles
- Slim for HTML
- Ruby as a server-side language
- JS/JQuery for AJAX and client-side validations
- Devise for authentication and CanCanCan to configure permissions
- RSpec for automated MVC unit tests
- Dragula to prioritize tasks
- Flatpickr to pick deadline
- Toastr for flashes
- Rubocop and rails_best_practices to analyze code
- Pry for debugging
